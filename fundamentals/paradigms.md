# Programming paradigms
**Programming paradigms** - are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. It's a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.

Common paradigms:
* **Imperative** - the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state (control flow is specified by serial orders). The imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform and on describing `HOW` a program operates. Languages: Java, JavaScript, PHP, Go, Python etc.
	* **Procedural** - groups instructions into procedures, which simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Languages: C, Java, JavaScript, Go, Python etc.
	* **Object-oriented** - groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on. Languages: C++, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Kotlin etc.
* **Declarative** - expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. Focuses on `WHAT` the program should accomplish without specifying "how" the program should achieve the result. Languages: HTML, SQL (DQL), Prolog etc
	* **Functional** - the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications. Programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. Haskell, Clojure, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Kotlin *(many so-called functional languages are "impure", containing imperative features)*
	* **Logic** - the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Languages: Prolog, Datalog etc
	* **Mathematical** - the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem (selection of the best element from some set of available alternatives).

> Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are **multi-paradigm** and they support object-oriented programming typically in combination with imperative, procedural, functional programming etc.
