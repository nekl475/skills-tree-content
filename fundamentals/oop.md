# Object-oriented programming (OOP)
**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** - is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods) that manipulates this data. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

OOP is based on **4 main principles**:
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance 
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction

> In **prototype-based languages** the objects are the primary entities (no classes exist). The `prototype` of an object is just another object to which the object is linked (object has one prototype link)
