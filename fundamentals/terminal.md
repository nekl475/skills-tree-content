# Terminal

**Terminals** (**console** or **command line**) - allows to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface. 
Using a terminal allows us to send simple text commands to our computer to do things like navigate through a directory or copy a file, and form the basis for many more complex automations and programming skills.
