# Service Mesh

**Service Mesh** - is a way to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. This **dedicated infrastructure layer** (for facilitating service-to-service communications) can document how well (or not) different parts of an app interact, so it becomes easier to optimize communication and avoid downtime as an app grows.
