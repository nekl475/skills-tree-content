# Continuous Integration and Delivery

**Continuous Integration (CI)** - is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)** - is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.
